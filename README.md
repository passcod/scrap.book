Not super sure what all this was about... a bit far now.

The `000 deafening` refers to, I think:
- 000 was the free webhost I was using at the time, 000webhost.com, famously breached some years later
- deafening was the page for the last letter in my first personal website iirc, refer to the first-website repo
